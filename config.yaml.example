# Oracle Database Connection (required). Name -> DSN. With one entry, all SQL uses that DB.
# With multiple entries, pass "connection" in execute_sql (see list_connections).
oracle:
  connections:
    database1: "user/pass@//host:1521/ORCL"
#    database2: "user/pass@//host2:1521/ORCL"
# Connection string format: user/password@//host:port/service_name

# Security Settings
security:
  # How to match danger_keywords: "whole_text" (default) or "tokens"
  # whole_text: case-insensitive substring in full SQL (e.g. column "created_at" matches "create")
  # tokens: exact token match after stripping strings/comments (e.g. "created_at" does not match "create")
  danger_keyword_match: "whole_text"

  # List of keywords that trigger user confirmation
  # Case-insensitive, supports multi-word keywords (e.g., "alter system", "execute immediate")
  danger_keywords:
    - truncate
    - drop
    - alter
    - shutdown
    - grant
    - delete
    - revoke
    - create
    - update
    - execute immediate
    - replace
    - call

  # If true, all DDL statements (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, etc.) require confirmation
  # even if they don't match danger_keywords
  require_confirm_for_ddl: true

# Logging Settings
logging:
  # Enable audit logging
  audit_log: true
  # When true, log one line per execute_sql: [debug] Execute Action: <type>, Connection: <name> (Cursor adds timestamp)
  verbose_logging: true

  # Path to audit log file (relative to executable or absolute path)
  log_file: "audit.log"
